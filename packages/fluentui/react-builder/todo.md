# TODO

## Accessibility

- [ ] generate accessibility spec
- [ ] store accessibility errors by uuid key
- [ ] enhance detail on accessibility tab
- [ ] enhance user understanding of accessibility errors/why they matter

## UI/UX

- [ ] create "frames" on the builder canvas (iPhone, tablet, web, etc.)
- [ ] add children from parent objects instead of displaying them on the add tab- eg. 'button content' should be
      inherited from 'button'. Could be part of component properties?
- [ ] add ability to change properties/manipulate objects on right click

## Development

- [ ] create test suite

## Bugs

- [ ] accessibility errors are not loaded when a component is dragged onto the canvas
- [ ] component tree collapses an item on click
- [ ] cannot deselect component by clicking on it
- [ ] `Form` crashes the builder
- [ ] Switch to store should remove tree_lz from URL
- [ ] remove ability attributes errors from removed components
